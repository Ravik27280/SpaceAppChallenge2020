The AI guide acts as a Historian and demonstrates the missions to the user. The user feels like he himself is exploring the place with a guide. The user gets to select what they want to explore and there is also an option to select a specific mission to explore. The guide i.e. the assistant tells the history for the missions carried out by NASA over the years and educates the user.
